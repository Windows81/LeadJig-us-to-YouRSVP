**It’s time to take action and regain control!**

You and your spouse are invited to join a select few couples for an exclusive and interactive roundtable discussion. You will learn about important changes in 2023 and the latest strategies to reduce taxes and protect and preserve your valuable assets for retirement and for the important people in your life.

New Tax Laws and recent changes to qualified retirement accounts and IRS-mandated Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) bring advantages and disadvantages. Some changes have the potential to be beneficial; however, you must make sure you are working with the most current and up‑to‑date information so you can help avoid costly mistakes.

If you make one small error, you and/or your heirs could be hit with severe penalties. This presentation will bring clarity to how the new changes impact your retirement and how to help avoid IRS problems.
